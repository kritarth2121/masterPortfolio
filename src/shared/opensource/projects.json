        "hellotax is a VAT compliance automation program designed for multi-channel retailers in Europe.",
        "The company already had a working web app, but they required a professional to design an altogether new experience using cutting-edge technologies to maximize speed and give an optimal user experience as their customer base grew. Because data is at the heart of the product, there was a lot of data processing and manipulation that needed to happen quickly.",
        "With this knowledge, I assessed the existing platform, began recording faults, and devised tactics to address them. We chose ReactJs since their in-house team was better experienced with it.I bootstrapped the project, and the designated MVP, which comprised a partial component library geared for accessibility, was available in a few weeks.",
        "Typically, systems that require a large amount of data manipulation and various computations opt to perform these activities on the server. However, because we were dealing with extremely large amounts of data (up to megabytes at times), the round trip time (RTT) was quite long, resulting in delayed updates. To address this, I had to construct a large portion of the processing and manipulation logic on the frontend while leaving particular computing tasks and business logic for the backend.",
        "Now, it's easy to go wrong and pollute data in these computations, so I created a bunch of fail-safe optimized utility libraries that implemented solid type-checks and validation techniques to ensure fast, yet accurate data diffing and transformation work to preserve the integrity of the information displayed and minimize runtime errors and unusability. After nine months of work, we were finally ready to launch the beta version. It not only met but exceeded expectations, outperforming the previous edition in terms of speed, accessibility, and dependability."

It was difficult to integrate all of these features while keeping performance and usability in mind. There were some hiccups, but it finally became stable and included many of Facebook Messenger's main features, which were rather attractive.",
